# Eye Tracking and Saccade Detection Project

## Overview
This project is designed to track eye movements and detect saccades, which are quick, simultaneous movements of both eyes in the same direction. It's aimed at researchers and clinicians who need to analyze eye movement patterns for various applications.

This software was developed as a capstone project for the University of Guelph's ENGG41x0 course. It is an academic project and should not be considered as a replacement for professional medical software or advice.

## Features
- **Eye Tracking**: Utilizes video input to track eye movements in real-time.
- **Saccade Detection**: Analyzes eye movement data to identify and report saccades.
- **Report Generation**: Generates a detailed report based on the eye tracking analysis, including metrics on saccade movements.
- **Customizable Exam Setup**: Allows users to configure parameters for different test scenarios.
